       <p>Hello and welcome to my portal page, a place where you can stay up-to-date with my projects and growing portfolio. </p>
       
       <p>I am an emerging professional in the tech industry, currently enrolled in a workforce training program known as Year Up. Year Up's mission is to close the opportunity divide by providing a professional environment for emerging professionals to practice their networking skills and technical abilities, both in and out of the classroom.</p>

       <p>The program is divided into two segments. The segment I’m currently in is the first of the two, known as the “Learning and Development” phase. Year Up partners with Seattle Central College to provide a hands-on learning experience in the classroom. Every day, we get the chance to put our hands on the keyboard and are refining our skills in coding languages including (but not limited to) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
       
       <p>The second part of the program is the opportunity to participate in an immersive internship with one of many highly regarded tech companies, some local to the greater Seattle Area. They have approximately 250+ partners, 41 of which are part of the Fortune 100. This segment uses your performance in the Learning and Development phase to match you with the best internship possible.</p>
      
       <p>My interest in the tech field began long ago, when Myspace was booming and everyone was friends with Tom. I loved playing with the customability of your personal profile, constructing a website unique to who you are. I was constantly refining my page with code to put my own touch on it through fonts, colors, background, images, and even extending my "Top 8" because I just couldn't choose eight friends. Since then, I've dabbled in several creative avenues of tech: Tumblr, web design classes in high school, even graphic design for an organization I regularly volunteered with. Now, I'm enrolled in classes through the program that has reignited my passion in coding to showcase creativity.</p>
      
       <p>I'm excited to seize this opportunity in developing my skills and pursuing higher education. Being a first-generation Filipina-American has shaped my drive to succeed to create a better life for myself, my lineage, and my legacy.</p>
       
       <p>Above, you will find links to previous class works, along with my Github and LinkedIn. I would love to connect with you!</p>
       <p>Cheers,</p>
       <p>Charlene.</p>
